# ZeroGravityAnimation 
    
Make random object fly on your screen. 

The repo helps in easier development of flying random  objects on random directions (or 
on specific directions) to give  a goodUI experience for the  user. Specifically made  for 
gaming  purpose, the repo will  be highly useful  for apps that deals  with space  related 
animations, thus  named as ZeroGravityAnimation. The animation  works with a class  called
OverTheTopLayer, that makes the object to fly on the top of the screen. A ViewGroup layout 
can be passed optionally that acts as a container for the animating objects.

####Sample:

The image illustrates the stars flying beneath the earth with the help of container layout  while a meteor and 
a satellite flying on the top of screen through OverTheTopLayer.

####Usage:

```java

int imgResource = R.drawable.star; // your animating object here
int count = 1;  // # of objects to fly
float scale = 0.2f; // scaling factor for the animating objects - value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0

// directions are optional and by default RANDOM will be picked
Direction origin = Direction.LEFT; // animation origin direction - can also use Direction.TOP, Direction.BOTTOM, Direction.LEFT or Direction.RANDOM
Direction destination = Direction.RIGHT; // same case as above for destination


ZeroGravityAnimation animation = new ZeroGravityAnimation();
animation.setCount(count);
animation.setScalingFactor(scale);
animation.setOriginationDirection(origin);
animation.setDestinationDirection(destination);
animation.setImage(resId);
animation.play(this);
  ```
  

#####Animation Listener: 
Default animation listener can used to collect events of this animation.
````java
animation.setAnimationListener(new Animation.AnimationListener() {
                                           @Override
                                           public void onAnimationStart(Animation animation) {

                                           }

                                           @Override
                                           public void onAnimationEnd(Animation animation) {
                                          
                                           }

                                           @Override
                                           public void onAnimationRepeat(Animation animation) {

                                           }
                                       }
        );
```

#####Animation Object Container Specification:
Wanted you animation to take place beneath certain views - like the stars that fly beneath Earth in the above demo? 
Make sure you design your layouts to have a container layout (FrameLayout) that lies below than the original views and use the following code
    
```java
  
  ViewGroup container = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.animation_container_layout); 
  animation.play(this,container);
```
